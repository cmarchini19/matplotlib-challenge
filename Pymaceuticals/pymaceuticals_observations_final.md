#Key Observations from analyzing Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo:
    #1. Capomulin was the only treatment that reduced tumor volume during the timeframe measured. These results indicate Capomulin is an effective treatment for reducing the size of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors.

    #2. Capomulin had the lowest number of metastatic sites, which indicates it is the most effective treatment for reducing the cancer spread of SCC.

    #3. Mice that had the Capomulin treatment had the highest survival rate overtime, whereas mice that had the Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo treatments had survival rates drop below 50%.
